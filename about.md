Hello! My name is Hayley Boyce and I'm a graduate student at UBC. I am in The MDS program which just stands for Master of Data Science.  
After Graduting with an undergraduate degree in Financial Modeling, I found that the new field of Data Analytics was a huge interest of mine. I hope to add to this blog as I learn more about the field, share with you all my new developments and anything else exciting that comes my way. 

### More Information

I love baking and being active. I once won a snowcone machine in friends trivia contest.
