Hello! My name is Hayley Boyce and I'm a graduate student at UBC. I am in The MDS program which is short hand for Master of Data Science.  
After Graduting with an undergraduate degree in Financial Modeling, I found that the new field of Data Analytics was a huge interest for me . I Hope to add to this blog as I learn more about the field and share with you all my new developments and anything exciting that comes my way. 

### More Information
